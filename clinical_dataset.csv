EQ-5D was calculated by two types of questionnaires Part A (descriptive health profile) and Part B (visual analogue scale). Part A, EQ-5D comprised 5-item questionnaires to measure own health profile status (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each measure has three levels (1. no problems, 2. some problems, 3. extreme problems). In Part B, visual analogue rating scale to measure how good or bad a health state was. Scale was drawn by using thermometer-like scale, on which the best state imagine was marked as 100 and worst state imagine was marked as 0."

The total score range is from 0 to 100, higher the score greater the NSAID intake and 0 represents no intake at all. A negative change from baseline indicates less NSAID consumption."

BIA equipment is affordable, widely available, and portable, especially single-frequency instruments. Muscle quantity will be determined by measuring the bilateral calf circumference with a tape measure and by BIA, which is considered one of the main standard tools for sarcopenia case-finding in clinical practice.

After meeting inclusion criteria, the software follows a schema unknown to the researchers to randomly select consented participants into appropriate arms of trial."

Clinical benefit is computed for each participant. A positive difference of post- and pre-operative HINT scores is considered clinically significant if it exceeded 10 percentage points (pp).

This scale consisting of 14 items is a 5-point Likert-type. The positive-meaning items are scored in reverse order. Therefore, the scores ranged from 14 to 70. The scale has no cutoff score, and high scores indicated higher breastfeedin self- efficacy.

There are two versions of the scale used during pregnancy and postpartum. In both versions, the items are the same and the tenses change. In order to evaluate the Turkish validity and reliability of both antenatal and postnatal versions of the scale, language, structure and predictive validity analyzes were performed and the Cronbach's alpha value was found to be 0.87 for the antenatal measurement tool and 0.86 for the postnatal measurement tool."

An index of 0 indicates a community that only has one species. A negative change indicates a decrease in diversity and a positive change indicates an increase in diversity.

The Simpson's Diversity Index is a measure of diversity which takes into account the number of species present, as well as the relative abundance of each species. As species richness and evenness increase, so diversity increases. The value ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 represents infinite diversity and 0, no diversity."

If there were multiple results on the same day, no matter from the same lab vendor or different lab vendors, then the worst value was used in the analysis.

The FHC-PA is a validated questionnaire containing three subscales: value, cohesion and information on PA in the family. In total, this questionnaire contains 14 items, where participants can score these items on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ""definitely false"" to 4 ""definitely true"".

With the exception of question 10 ""Functioning before knee injury"", the remaining 18 response points are summed up. This gives the ""raw sum"". The lowest possible score is 18 and the maximum possible score is 87. The raw sum is converted into a scale of 0 to 100 using the following formula: ((raw score - lowest possible score)/score range)*100. 0 points mean the greatest possible impairment, while 100 points mean complete freedom from symptoms and functioning.

Patients included in the trial according to the following criteria will be treated and followed-up according to the standard of care (SOC). All eligible patients have an indication to LT beyond the aims of this study, and will undergo LT according to National indications. LT is the gold standard treatment for patients affected by HCC inside Milan criteria, however biological features of the tumor may modify the expected recurrence pattern.

This aim will be focused on the potential role for MP in the modulation of tumor recurrence pattern.

The SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability, while the higher the score the less disability. Additionally, two summary scale scores can be calculated: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). Summary statistics were calculated for each of the 8 scales, the 2 summary measures, and changes from baseline for each treatment group."

This analysis will assess functional connectivity between the region of interest (ROI) voxel, the right Crus I of the cerebellum, compared to all other voxels in the brain. Seed-based voxel correlation analysis enables researchers to see the statistical correlation between the ROI activity and activity in other cortical areas. This correlation reveals patterns of connectivity between the ROI and other cortical regions.
